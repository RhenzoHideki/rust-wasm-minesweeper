# rust-wasm-minesweeper
A project attempting to learn rust and wasm

## TODO: 
In Minesweeper, hidden mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have multiple possible states:
- [ ] Unopened tiles (cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- [ ] Blank tiles (no mines are on the diagonal/adjacent to the tile)
- [ ] Numbered tiles (can show 1-8)
- [ ] Flagged tiles (right-clicking an unopened tile)
- [ ] Make minefield variable in size
